# [My Portfolio]([https://github.com/etrifonova/My-Portfolio](https://etrifonova.github.io/My-Portfolio/))

Inititally based on the portfolio which I created thanks to this tutorial by freeCodeCamp https://youtu.be/xV7S8BhIeBo. Later on I duplicated the repo containing that portfolio into this one in order to play with it a bit and modify it the way I want.
